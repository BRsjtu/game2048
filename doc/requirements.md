# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a fully playable 2048 game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game will include a visual game board with smooth animations, keyboard controls, undo/redo functionality, and an AI auto-play feature that can automatically play and win the game. The implementation must be built from scratch without external game engines or libraries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to play the 2048 game with a visual interface, so that I can enjoy the classic tile-sliding puzzle game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display a 4x4 grid game board
2. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL place two random tiles (2 or 4) on the board
3. WHEN a player uses arrow keys THEN the system SHALL move all tiles in the specified direction
4. WHEN tiles with the same number collide THEN the system SHALL merge them into a single tile with doubled value
5. WHEN tiles move or merge THEN the system SHALL display smooth animations
6. WHEN a move is made THEN the system SHALL add a new random tile (2 or 4) to an empty position
7. WHEN the player reaches 2048 THEN the system SHALL display a victory message
8. WHEN no moves are possible THEN the system SHALL display a game over message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to control the game using keyboard input, so that I can interact with the game naturally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player presses the up arrow key THEN the system SHALL move all tiles upward
2. WHEN the player presses the down arrow key THEN the system SHALL move all tiles downward
3. WHEN the player presses the left arrow key THEN the system SHALL move all tiles leftward
4. WHEN the player presses the right arrow key THEN the system SHALL move all tiles rightward
5. WHEN an invalid move is attempted THEN the system SHALL not change the board state
6. WHEN the game is over THEN the system SHALL ignore further keyboard input

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to undo and redo my moves, so that I can experiment with different strategies and correct mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player makes a move THEN the system SHALL save the previous board state to history
2. WHEN the player requests an undo THEN the system SHALL restore the previous board state
3. WHEN the player requests a redo THEN the system SHALL restore the next board state in history
4. WHEN there are no previous states THEN the system SHALL disable the undo function
5. WHEN there are no future states THEN the system SHALL disable the redo function
6. WHEN a new move is made after an undo THEN the system SHALL clear the redo history

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want an AI auto-play feature, so that I can watch the game play itself and learn optimal strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player activates auto-play THEN the system SHALL use an AI algorithm to make moves automatically
2. WHEN the AI is active THEN the system SHALL make moves at a reasonable pace for observation
3. WHEN the AI makes a move THEN the system SHALL use the same game logic as manual play
4. WHEN the AI reaches 2048 or game over THEN the system SHALL stop auto-play
5. WHEN the player deactivates auto-play THEN the system SHALL return control to manual input
6. WHEN the AI algorithm evaluates moves THEN the system SHALL use expectimax or greedy search strategy

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want a clean and responsive user interface, so that I can enjoy a polished gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display a visually appealing game board with proper styling
2. WHEN tiles appear or move THEN the system SHALL show smooth CSS animations
3. WHEN tiles merge THEN the system SHALL display a merge animation
4. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL update the score display
5. WHEN buttons are present THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback on interaction
6. WHEN the game is played on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper proportions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want game state management, so that I can track my progress and restart when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the score to zero
2. WHEN tiles merge THEN the system SHALL add the merged tile value to the score
3. WHEN the player requests a restart THEN the system SHALL reset the board and score
4. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL display the final score
5. WHEN the game is restarted THEN the system SHALL clear the undo/redo history
